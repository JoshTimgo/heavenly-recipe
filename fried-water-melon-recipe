Ingredients :  (missing ......laughs) You think of a way to preseve like putting some like food preservations 
							- this for 6 months or more - like dreep freezed or refrigerated 
							* Main ingredient - dehydrated fruit peices 
								
							(any single fruit (unmarried - heh hih hih) - (for now only single or just one fruit -
							later when you master in it- you will mix it - (don't make it a paste 
							- it won't taste well) Upto 37% water in it only or optimum water
							level for a crunch or munch (as I guessed it - for some fruits -
							it may vary)
							
							you could make it better by injecting caramel + pure sugar in to  fruit
							pieces before dehydrate process. 
							-Just to make it crisp enough to munch as it like a buiscuit in side your mouth)
				   			You could eat alone .... crunch it... munch it...mmmm-hey///dat's my dream///
				   			u stole it.///ihhe ihhe////
				   
				 -- (For this senario a vacume cooker or cookers may be or should be a normal
				 thing in the past in the history... when ... one day if some one asks you
				 who invented vacume cooker... he or she could feel it as a normal thing in the past-
				 cause it's dangerous) --
sub recepie  - (When crushed in to small quater an inched size - may use it as a decorative item for ice cream s and
			ice cream sundays-as you know already )

This fruit recepie is only for over 40 Yr of aged. may be dangerous (science experiments 
						     - shock hazard - since... we use vacume technology to this - 
						        so far only scientists use this for their experimental uses only)
						        
			* - For the batter - wheat four 100g 
						     
						     - Icing sugar 125g
						     
						     - tiny peices of dried sugar caramel 200g - tiny peices 1 to 2mm sized 
						        ( how to make it - first 
						        make sugar caramel as usual - dehydrate or let it evaporate water safely 
						        and hygeinly
						        NB : for this you may use sun shine or sun's heat direct -
						        but remember when sun dried sugar or fruit direct - as you already know 
						        it contains ultra violet rays - those rays destroys human genomes and decays
						        plastics - sooner than you think - so it happens same to the sugar , fruit etc. )
						        
						     - crushed marie biscuits into 2-3mm sized 100g
						     
						     - a plastic vacume wrap bag - a thick one (this could be used to wrap this fruit
						        dessert inside and take all the air out of the bag while vacume 
						        sealing it for later use )
						     
			  How to prepare     : first make the batter - use mild hot water to mix 
						         wheat flour, icing sugar and let it cool inside a fridge
						         inside a plasitc container sealed - after 30 minutes take it out mix it with
						         ,caramel peices and crushed marie buiscuits)
						         
						         wrap the dried fruit or fruits with this batter covered each and every side
						         of it . 
						         let it fry deep inside a oil fry pan with a premium quality frying or cooking oil 
						         cause it might have taste varients.
						         after it turns it's color to brown enough or dark brown take it out
						         let it cool inside a vacum cooler. (cause we need to dry cool it leaving it 
						         without any water waper)
						         
						         in the mean time take the plastic wrap put all the dry cooled friuts inside
						         fix it in to the vacume machine and seal it after using the same.
						         
						         Done.
						         
						         (For preserving or to put in to super markets you could dry fruits 
						         - soaked with food preservatives and mix the batter with relevent 
						         food presevatives
